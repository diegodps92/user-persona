# User Persona based on an survey of the intensive use of technology of different Mobile App Users. 


The analysis shows how can we make a user persona with Machine Learning non-supervised to then make different strategies when we segment our different customers. For example, in this analysis of a survey of the use of technology, we found that we could separate the analysis in personal, demographics, and behaviour characteristics. After we clustered the found customers that clusters 3 and 4 had, were the highest number of people. 

So the decision taken to target the different customers were the following: 

Time managers 
Although cluster 4 has the highest number of people for both males and females, they are the least likely to research products before purchase. Therefore, showing that this cluster has impulse buyers. The first recommendation is to develop emotional, upbeat, and positive marketing campaigns because these campaigns are more likely to attract impulse buyers.

Apprentice & Opinion leader 
Clusters 3 & 4 are not opinion leaders or apprentices. They are comfortable with the status quo and uncomfortable with change. The marketing budget for these clusters should be below, as they are unlikely to buy new tech products that they consider disruptive to their current lifestyle.


Optimistic
Cluster 3 are creatives and active. For this cluster, the company can invest in developing apps with daily challenges, providing the opportunity for customers to share their wins and progress. 43% of Optimistic are aged 18 - 29 years, further reinstating that the company should focus on apps for active customers. Also, 70% of Optimistic people have over ten apps on their devices, making it possible to have different apps that cater to different aspects of their lifestyle. 


Influencer
Clusters 3 & 4 are influencers who like to be in control. 46% of influencers have over 31 apps on their devices, and 41% of them are single. They are mostly female. We will recommend that we employ members of these clusters as influencers by introducing a referral program in which they are rewarded for referring and acquiring new customers.
